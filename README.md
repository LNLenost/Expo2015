# What the heck even is EXPO?
From Wikipedia:

Expo 2015 was a World Expo hosted by Milan, Italy. It opened on May 1 at 10:00 CEST and closed on October 31. Milan hosted an exposition for the second time; the first was the 1906 Milan International.

The Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) general assembly in Paris decided in favour of Milan on March 31, 2008. On November 23, 2010, the event was announced by the BIE. Expo 2015's theme was "Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life".

# Backstory about the Virtual Tour website
The Virtual Tour website was taken down between December 2020 and May 2023 (we do not have an exact date).

Trying to visit the original website (http://virtual.expo2015.org) right now shows an error message. As of 03/08/2025, it says "This is an error!" making you think there is an error, right? Well, take a look at the index.html file...

```
<html><head><title>Error</title></head>
<body>
This is an error!

</body></html>
```

Yeah... this is not an error. They make us believe it is, though.
On 07/03/2025, I found a [backup of the Virtual Tour website](http://virtualexpo2015.s3-website.eu-south-1.amazonaws.com/) which I thought was lost to time. I cannot exactly date back to when was this cloned (or more importantly, how), but it is incredible how someone is still paying to keep this wesbite up. To whoever did this, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

The data I got from the website comes in fact from the backup. I somehow cannot get it working on Netlify as of now though, I'm still working on it.
