# What the heck even is EXPO?
From Wikipedia:
Expo 2015 was a World Expo hosted by Milan, Italy. It opened on May 1 at 10:00 CEST and closed on October 31. Milan hosted an exposition for the second time; the first was the 1906 Milan International.

The Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) general assembly in Paris decided in favour of Milan on March 31, 2008. On November 23, 2010, the event was announced by the BIE. Expo 2015's theme was "Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life".

# Backstory about the website
The Virtual Tour website was taken down between December 2020 and May 2023 (we do not have an exact date).

Trying to visit the original website (http://virtual.expo2015.org) right now shows an error message. As of 03/08/2025, it says "This is an error!" making you think there is an error, right? Well, take a look at the index.html file...

	<html><head><title>Error</title></head>

This is an error!

Yeah... this is not an error. They make us believe it is, though.
