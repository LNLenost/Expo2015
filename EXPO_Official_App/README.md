# Backstory about the app
Both of the APKs you can find here were dumped from my mum's old phone (shoutout to my mom).
I am currently looking for the IPAs, but they seem to be lost... as of now.

# Expo 2015 1.1.apk
This APK partially works and was released before EXPO begun.
As soon as you open the app it tells you how many days are left since the beginning of the event... but since it was more than 10 years ago the countdown broke. Maybe it tries to connect to a dead timezone server?
